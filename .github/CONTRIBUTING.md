2. **Create a feature branch**, for example:

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes, following the style and structure of the project or package you are modifying.
4. Add tests or verify that your changes work as expected.
5. Commit your work using clear, descriptive commit messages.
6. Push your branch:

   ```
7. Open a Pull Request.
   In your PR description, include:

- What you changed
- Why you changed it
- Any related issues or context

## Reporting Issues

Before opening a new issue:

- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Provide a clear description of the problem or feature request.
- For bugs, include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
- For feature requests, explain the problem the feature solves and any alternatives you’ve considered.

## Code Style & Tests

- Follow the existing coding conventions (formatting, naming, structure).
- Update or add tests when appropriate.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR (if a test suite is available).
- Keep changes focused—smaller, well‑scoped PRs are easier to review and merge.
